Ashley Naffziger recently joined us to help answer a few of the most common questions that we’re hearing from buyers out there. **The first is, “How can I win in this market?”**

According to Ashley, the first step to winning in this market is by getting pre-qualified by meeting with a local mortgage lender. It’s always important to know what you qualify for, otherwise you’re just wasting your time.

**Another question we hear all the time is, “How many homes am I going to have to see before I find the right one?”** The answer to this question varies. Other teams and agents may show around 20 homes before a buyer finds a home they want to write an offer on. Here at the Benjamin Martin Team, we only show an average of five homes before our buyers get to this point because of our thorough pre-qualification meeting with our buyers.

**In that meeting, we go through the buyer’s home needs thoroughly.** We have them identify everything they want in a home, make a top-five list, and pinpoint the homes that they really want to see.

Finally, buyers want to know what they can do to stand out against the heavy competition and make a winning offer. Ashley has actually had great success and has gotten her buyers their dream house 100% of the time she has used it. **She’s never lost an offer when using this strategy.**

If you’re a buyer and you’re looking to buy in this competitive market, you need an expert like Ashley in order to get the home you want at the price you want. If you have any questions for us about the market or about how we can help you find the perfect home, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
