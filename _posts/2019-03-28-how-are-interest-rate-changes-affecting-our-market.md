{% include youtube.html %}<br><br>What’s going on with interest rates? What are the latest numbers from our Fresno market?&nbsp;

Let’s start with the news surrounding interest rates. It was believed that the Federal Reserve would raise rates three times this year, but after they raised them once at the beginning of the year, that produced a negative reaction from the market. The stock market tanked, so people stopped buying homes. Because of the uncertainty created by this, the first quarter has been really slow.&nbsp;

Now, **the Federal Reserve has announced that they’ll hold back on raising rates, which is good for both buyers and sellers**—buyers can come back to the market and get a phenomenal rate, and sellers can get their homes sold. The market is shifting, but you’re better off buying now than waiting until later. If rates go up over the course of this year, affordability will go down, and so will prices. If you buy now, you’ll pay less in long-term interest over the life of your loan.&nbsp;

What do the latest numbers say about our market?&nbsp;

There are currently 2,481 homes for sale. Last month, there were 604 home sales, and there are 990 homes currently pending<br><br>{% include pullquote.html %}

Year over year, the average price per square foot has increased from $157 to $162. The average days on market has also increased year over year from 50 to 62 days, which means buyers are taking longer to make a decision because of all the uncertainty mentioned above. The average active price has dropped year over year by 1%, but the average sold price is up by 1.4%

Finally, our months of inventory has risen year over year from 2.2 months to 4.1 months. A buyer’s market is defined as having more than six months of inventory, while a seller’s market is defined as having less than six months. As you can see, this indicates we’re moving toward a buyer’s market, so we should see a softening of prices coming up. **If you’re a seller, this also means you need to act now or risk losing money down the road.&nbsp;**
