My team and I believe strongly in the power of giving back. And one of my favorite ways to do so is by sharing knowledge, which is exactly what I’d like to do in today’s message.

Joining me in the video above is none other than my own father: **Reverend Dr. Bryan Martin, who is here to talk about his two new books—both of which center on his favorite topic: love.&nbsp;**

These two books, titled “The Kindness Book” and “Oxytocin Is the ‘O’ in ‘Love': How to Maintain and Sustain an Emotional Connection,” are the final installments in his four-part series. The latter of these two books has not yet been published, but is sure to be just as incredible as the three he’s released so far.&nbsp;

In true romantic fashion, my father cites his relationship with my mother as the inspiration for this series. He says that the pair of them are “relationship billionaires,” and I absolutely agree. And just like all billionaires should do, my father believes it’s his responsibility to give back by spreading the wealth of knowledge that has helped shape his relationship. His books are his way of striving toward that goal.

In addition to the two new books I mentioned earlier, I also highly recommend his two previous books: “Fun Loving: How to Have a Practically Perfect Relationship” and “Kindness Is the Most Powerful Little Thing in the World.”&nbsp;

**You can find all of his titles on Amazon, so be sure to check them out for yourself soon.&nbsp;**

If you have any other questions or would like more information about this or about your real estate goals, feel free to give me or my team a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
