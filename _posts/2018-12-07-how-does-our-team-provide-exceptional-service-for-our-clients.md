Today I’m delighted to be joined by Naomi Rhodus, the COO of my team and one of the best people on the planet. She’s going to share how we always make sure we provide our clients with a 10+ customer experience.

**Naomi is passionate about working with our clients and making sure they are comfortable throughout the entire transaction.** We have plenty of systems in place to make sure that everything is taken care of throughout the transaction. We’re able to track deadlines, inspections, and everything else from contract to close so a fantastic experience is essentially automatic.

**Naomi’s job is to make sure that we make your contract-to-close experience a 10+ experience and take care of all of your wants and needs throughout the transaction.** One of the biggest complaints that we hear as Realtors is a lack of communication. We bridge that gap by thinking about our clients as family and friends. We make sure that they understand everything that’s going on and are involved with every step of the transaction. From the time a home goes on the market, to the time it closes escrow, they know what’s going on at any given time.

If you’re looking for a real estate team that will make sure you have the best experience possible and are treated like family, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
