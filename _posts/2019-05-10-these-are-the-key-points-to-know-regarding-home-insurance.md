Today I’m joined by Kevin Lisitsin of Farmers Insurance to quickly discuss three key points regarding home insurance that you need to be aware of.&nbsp;

First, **you should have a representative you can work with locally.** If you ever have a claim, it’s great to be able to call someone in your area who can help you.&nbsp;

Second, **there’s a difference between actual cash value and replacement cost policies.** Actual cash value means there’s depreciation when you incur a loss. With replacement cost policies, there is zero depreciation; you’re paid for the loss and given a refund for the difference between what an item costs and what the actual cash value was. &nbsp;

Third, **you can bundle other insurance policies together.** This way, you’re able to maximize the purchase of the home and get other discounts on, for example, your auto insurance.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about this topic, feel free to give Kevin a call at (559) 360-2809.&nbsp;

As always, if you have any real estate questions, don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be happy to help you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
