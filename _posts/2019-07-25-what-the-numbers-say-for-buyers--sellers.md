What do the latest numbers say about our Fresno marketplace?

A few short months ago, interest rates started to rise quickly, which gave our market quite a scare. A lot of buyers changed their plans, and inventory started to go up. Since then, though, **rates have come back down, consumer confidence has increased, and more buyers have come back to the market.&nbsp;**

As a result, inventory is going back down. The definition of a seller’s market is whenever there is less than six months of inventory, while the definition of a buyer’s market is whenever there is more than six months of inventory. **Right now, we have about two months of inventory.&nbsp;**

As of the recording of this video, there are 2,626 homes on the market as &nbsp;Last month, there were 1,051 home sales. If we continue to sell 1,000+ homes per month and don’t replenish that supply, it would put us at about 1.4 or 1.5 months of inventory. If you’re a seller, it’s obviously better to sell when there’s no competition, so if I were you, I’d sell sooner rather than later.&nbsp;

The average price per square foot for homes in our area is $173, but that average encompasses the entire market, so it might not apply to your home. If you want to get an accurate estimate of what your home is worth, call me and I’d be happy to help you.&nbsp;

**Homes are staying on the market for an average of 47 days before they sell, and the average list-to-sale price ratio is about 98%**, which means you’re likely to sell your home for 98% of its market value after you list it.&nbsp;

The bottom line is it’s a seller’s market out there, but more homes are always being listed. If you’re looking to buy, you can still get a great house. Just remember to move quickly.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions about our Fresno market or you’re thinking of buying or selling, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
