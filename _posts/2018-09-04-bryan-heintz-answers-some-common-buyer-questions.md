Today we are here with a great friend and lender extraordinaire, Bryan Heintz with Sierra Pacific Mortgage. **We'll ask him some common questions that homebuyers tend to have and let him use his expertise to answer them.**

Many buyers are put off and fearful of the home buying process. They don’t know what they don’t know and aren’t sure if they will get approved. **How can Brian help buyers alleviate that fear?**

With new buyers, Bryan and his team do a great job of easing their minds. He gives them a call, then either meets with them in person or invites them to apply online. He lets buyers know that he’s here to help. **If they’re afraid of not qualifying at the moment, they can tailor a game plan for them to get approved down the line.** Bryan and his team also help with credit repair, saving for down payments, and more. They can pull credit without it affecting the score and have a great process in place.

Most people are worried about not qualifying right away, so they also focus on getting buyers excited to start the process.

**We have known Bryan for 16 years and have been using his services ever since.** If you're looking for a great, knowledgeable lender to work with, Bryan is the man. He can get you the best loan programs and the best rates as well as put you on the best path toward success. He also happens to be a Marine Corps Veteran.
